Visualization for Missile-Code

This respository has the code for the visualization of a single run of the missile engagement simulation described in Kara Dowling's Princeton University ORFE senior thesis, "A Multi-agent Stochastic Control Model for Adversarial Planning in Naval Operations."

Follow the directions in https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/mac/ to download Princeton's standard draw environment.  This is needed to run the code.

Follow the directions in MissileSimulation.java to run the visual simulation from the output animationFile.txt from MissileDriverScript.py
